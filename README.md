# Boston Crimes AnalysisüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is a Data Science project for the Python and R Lab Course. 
We used a dataset containing records from the new crime incident report system of Boston, which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well as when and where it occurred to analyze some variables and deduce some insights from the data. 

The purpose of this project is to thoroughly examine the dataset, identify significant patterns or trends in crime-related information, and derive useful insights to better understand the context of criminal incidents. 

During this analysis, we applied various Data Science techniques and data visualization to provide an in-depth view of the collected data

# The Dataset üìä 
The "Crimes in Boston" dataset, available on Kaggle, gathers detailed data on criminal incidents in the city of Boston, spanning from 2015 to 2018. 
This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of crimes occurring across different areas of the city, offering a broad perspective on urban safety dynamics and crime patterns.

*Dataset Content*  
Each row in the dataset represents a criminal incident and includes the following columns:

* INCIDENT_NUMBER: A unique identifier for the incident.
* OFFENSE_CODE: A numerical code categorizing the type of crime.
* OFFENSE_CODE_GROUP: A general category of the crime.
* OFFENSE_DESCRIPTION: A detailed description of the crime.
* DISTRICT: The district where the incident occurred.
* REPORTING_AREA: A specific area within the district.
* SHOOTING: Indicates the presence of a shooting incident.
* OCCURRED_ON_DATE: Date and time of the incident.
* YEAR: The year of the incident.
* MONTH: The month of the incident.
* DAY_OF_WEEK: The day of the week of the incident.
* HOUR: The hour of the day when the incident occurred.
* UCR_PART: Classification of the crime according to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) system.
* STREET: The street where the incident took place.
* Lat: Latitude of the incident location.
* Long: Longitude of the incident location.
* Location: Geographical coordinates of the incident.  

*Dataset Usage*  
The "Crimes in Boston" dataset is a valuable tool for:

* Statistical Analysis: Provides quantitative data for studies on crime patterns.
* Criminological Research: Useful for understanding the dynamics of crime in urban settings.
* Public Safety Planning: Supports authorities in planning security measures.
* Urban and Social Studies: Offers insights into urban and social dynamics related to crime.
* Through this information, the dataset proves to be an important resource for researchers, data analysts, urban planners, and public safety policy makers, offering a comprehensive and essential view for understanding and addressing the challenges of urban crime in Boston.
